# PyMod
pymodlib Is a python library for communication protocol modbus/tcp with Siemens LOGO 8

The addresses on the server are not the same as on the controller, but this library is capable of matching them.
It was tested with LOGO 8 but it's posible works with other PLCs Siemens.                                  

INSTALL  'pip3 install pymodlib'
